# WebhookRelay.net

Simple Azure based web relay provider.

Send requests to the Azure function, request payloads are published on the Azure service bus and can be pulled by the destributor application hosted on your local server.

Requests require a security key

# Support

This app was written to serve as a relay for the company I was working for & is no longer used.

It is shared, without support in case someone else has the same problems I had.

If you need help with the setup, please contact me and I will be happy to help.  Contact details on [my website](https://blyth.me.uk)

When running this in Azure, it serviced many requests per month and cost approximately Â£0.08 per month (which was for Azure Service Bus)

The function never hit the levels enough to require payment!
